# ERS- Python

## Project Description

In this project, I created a reimbursement system for a corporate environment. In this system there are two roles: employee and manager. Employees can submit reimbursement requests and view the requests that they have put in, along with the status of said requests (Pending, Approved, Denied). Managers can view all reimbursement requests put in by employees, approve or deny requests, and view statistics about reimbursement costs.
